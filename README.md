# Soundsphere

Using three.js, Audio API, and ASCII converter, I made this visual effect to visualise music or input sound from your microphone. Here I also experiment on device accelerometer using `deviceorientation`, `devicemotion`, and `MozOrientation`, so do try it out on mobile as well if you like.
